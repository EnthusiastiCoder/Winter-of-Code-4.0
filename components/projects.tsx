Whether you're just starting your journey or looking to sharpen your skills, this is the place for you.\n\nHere are some key points for contributors:\n\n1. Focus on Deep Learning Models: We encourage contributors to concentrate primarily on implementing deep learning models rather than basic machine learning models. Please review the issues section thoroughly, select one that matches your expertise, and propose your approach with various deep learning methods and models before requesting assignment.\n\n2. Explore OpenCV Implementations: Several issues in this repository involve OpenCV. Contributing to these will provide valuable hands-on experience and enhance your proficiency with OpenCV, which is a crucial skill for many deep learning tasks.\n\n3. NLP is a Key Area: We have several NLP-related issues that require attention. Be sure to fully understand the problem statements before diving into the implementation, and tailor your models to meet the requirements specified in each issue template."

This project will add color-coded hints along the slider to show the key the track will shift to at different slider positions.\n\n2) Key Tuning: Mixxx does not show tuning information of tracks, which makes harmonic mixing difficult in case of non 440 Hz tuning.
